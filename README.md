# ObjectDetectionApp using autonomous vehicles

This project was inspired by the tensorflow lite recognize flower project:

* [TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Android Demo](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/android)

## Introduction

In this project, object detection was made using autonomous vehicle images.2972 images were used. They were divided into 504 validation sets and 498 test sets.

* Images from Berkeley used [Berkeley Dataset](https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/)
* The model to be used for the application was created by following the tensorflow model maker. [Object Detection with TensorFlow Lite Model Maker](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/tutorials/model_maker_object_detection)
